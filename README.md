# Variable Font Guide Demos

Originally this website was published at <https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/testdrive/demos/variable-fonts> but this is no longer online.

It was announced at <https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2018/03/13/bringing-expressive-performant-typography-to-microsoft-edge-with-variable-fonts>

It was published under a libre license as part of a set of interoperable and open source demos that lived at the now defunct [Microsoft Edge Dev Site](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/testdrive/).
The main goal was to show new web features supported by Microsoft Edge in a way that work across all modern browsers. The Edge team hoped users would find them interesting and helpful.

In May 2022, Dave Crossland retrieved the archived repo at <https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/Demos-old> and removed the non-variable-fonts parts of the repo and re-hosted it on Github pages.
